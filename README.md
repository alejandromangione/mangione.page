## Personal website

The previous version of my website I did using Jekyll and them I realized that it was a total overkill for a single page. Nothing fancy here, just HTML, ~~CSS and Javascript~~, Sass, Babel.

### Local server

Run:

`$ foreman start`

#### Dependencies
- Ruby
  - foreman
- Sass
- Babel
